Journal Entry 1:
Today was emotionally draining. I had to give a presentation at work, and despite preparing thoroughly, I kept doubting myself. I could feel my heart pounding, my voice trembled at times, and even though people said it went well, I keep replaying every moment and thinking about how I must have looked nervous. I hate how hard I am on myself. I wish I could feel proud — even just for a second.

---

Journal Entry 2:
I didn’t do much today. Just stayed in bed, scrolled through my phone for hours. I know it’s not good for me, but I felt paralyzed. Like nothing I do matters. It scares me how easily I can disconnect from everything.

---

Journal Entry 3:
Had a session with my therapist. We talked about how I catastrophize things. I tend to jump to the worst-case scenario — like if someone doesn’t reply, I assume they hate me. I’m starting to realize that my thoughts aren’t always facts. That’s a weird, but comforting idea.

---

Journal Entry 4:
Got into an argument with my mom. She said something small, and I exploded. Later I realized I wasn’t even mad at her — I was just stressed. I feel so ashamed of how reactive I can be. I don’t want to push people away.

---

Journal Entry 5:
Today felt lighter. I went for a walk, and for the first time in a while, I noticed the trees, the breeze, the sunlight. It reminded me that I’m still here. I’m still breathing. That means something.

---

Journal Entry 6:
There’s this voice in my head that keeps telling me I’m a failure. It doesn’t matter what I do, it finds a way to undermine it. I don’t know if it’s my inner critic, or just depression speaking. Either way, it’s exhausting.

---

Journal Entry 7:
I had coffee with an old friend today. I almost canceled, but I’m glad I didn’t. It reminded me that I’m not completely alone, even though I often feel that way. She didn’t judge me — she just listened.

---

Journal Entry 8:
Didn’t sleep much last night. My mind wouldn’t shut off — just endless loops of “what ifs.” What if I lose my job? What if no one ever loves me? What if I stay stuck forever? It’s like anxiety is my default setting.

---

Journal Entry 9:
I managed to journal instead of doomscrolling tonight. It helped. Getting the thoughts out of my head and onto paper feels like a release. I wonder why I don’t do this more often.

---

Journal Entry 10:
Something clicked today. My therapist said, “You’re allowed to take up space.” I’d never thought of that before. I’ve always shrunk myself, made myself small. Maybe it’s time to stop apologizing for existing.

---

Journal Entry 11:
I noticed a pattern today. Every time I feel overwhelmed, I isolate. I stop replying, stop showing up, stop talking. But that just makes it worse. I’m realizing that connection — even if it’s just one person — is crucial for my sanity.

---

Journal Entry 12:
I looked in the mirror today and didn’t like what I saw. Not just physically — emotionally. I feel like a mess. But maybe that’s okay. Maybe healing doesn’t look pretty all the time. Maybe this is part of it.

---

Journal Entry 13:
I tried a grounding exercise: 5 things I see, 4 I can touch, 3 I hear, 2 I smell, 1 I taste. It actually helped. I was in the middle of a spiral, and this pulled me out, at least a little. I want to learn more tools like this.

---

Journal Entry 14:
I caught myself using “should” again — “I should be more productive,” “I should be over this by now.” My therapist says that “should” often hides shame. Maybe instead of “should,” I can ask what I need.

---

Journal Entry 15:
I opened up to my sibling about how I’ve been feeling. It was terrifying, but they were really supportive. I cried after — not from sadness, but relief. For once, I didn’t have to pretend I was okay.

---

Journal Entry 16:
The world feels really heavy. The news, social media — everything feels too much. I deleted a few apps today and just sat with myself. It was uncomfortable, but I think I needed it.

---

Journal Entry 17:
I don’t know who I am without my anxiety. It’s been there for so long, like a shadow. I wonder what’s underneath — who I’d be if I wasn’t always afraid.

---

Journal Entry 18:
My inner child came up today. I remembered how I used to love drawing, dancing, just being silly. Somewhere along the way, I started believing I had to be serious all the time. Maybe I should reconnect with that kid again.

---

Journal Entry 19:
Had a decent day. Did the laundry, cleaned the kitchen, cooked for myself. Nothing major, but it felt like progress. I’m learning that healing isn’t about big moments — it’s in the quiet acts of care.

---

Journal Entry 20:
I’m not okay. But I think I’m learning how to be okay with not being okay. That’s a shift. I don’t have all the answers, but I’m still here. Still trying. That counts for something.
